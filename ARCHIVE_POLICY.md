## Maintainer Checklist

1. Land change in monorepo first.
2. Sync mirror with canonical commit hash reference.
3. Keep issue/PR templates redirecting to monorepo.
4. Keep README canonical banner + policy link visible.

## Archive Lock Checklist (Final Pass)

- [ ] GitHub repo description starts with: `[MIRROR - READ ONLY]`.
- [ ] GitHub repo homepage points to: `https://github.com/mapleleaflatte03/meridian`.
- [ ] `README.md` top section states this repo is a mirror for `meridian/kernel`.

- [ ] All issue templates redirect users to monorepo issues/discussions/security links.
- [ ] `.github/pull_request_template.md` redirects PR authors to monorepo path `kernel/`.

- [ ] Mirror updates are sync-only from monorepo commits (no feature work here).
- [ ] Optional hard lock: archive this repo in GitHub UI after redirects are confirmed.

### Completion Gate
