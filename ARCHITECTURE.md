> Architecture in Meridian is not “the runtime.” It is the governance boundary, the proof boundary, and the separation that lets runtimes change without corrupting constitutional state.

# Architecture

## Design Thesis

AI agents need governance the same way processes need an operating system.
Meridian provides five composable primitives that any agent runtime can adopt
to enforce identity, authority, budget, and accountability.

**Meridian does not run agents. It governs them.**

Any runtime — local subprocess, hosted API, MCP-backed tool server, A2A-capable
agent, LangGraph pipeline, or custom stack — can have its agents governed by
Meridian if it satisfies the [Constitutional Runtime Contract](docs/RUNTIME_CONTRACT.md).

## Runtime-Neutral Design

Meridian is the governance layer, not the execution layer. This is a deliberate
architectural choice:

| Layer | What It Does | Who Owns It |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| **Agent Runtime** | Executes agents, manages LLM calls, routes tools | You |
| **Meridian Kernel** | Governs agents: identity, authority, budget, accountability | Meridian |
| **Economy Layer** | Scoring, sanctions, authority mechanics | Meridian |

This separation means:
- You keep your runtime architecture
- Meridian handles constitutional enforcement at the boundary
- Switching runtimes does not require rebuilding governance
- Multiple runtimes can share the same Meridian kernel

The [Constitutional Runtime Contract](docs/RUNTIME_CONTRACT.md) defines the
seven integration hooks that make a runtime governable.

## Current Proof Boundary

Meridian is runtime-neutral in design, but the current public proof is still
deliberately narrow:

- the five kernel primitives are real
- the reference workspace is real
- `runtime_core` now surfaces institution context, host identity, boundary
  identity model, service registry, admission state, and federation gateway
  state as machine-readable state
- one built-in runtime path (`local_kernel`) is the real reference adapter
- one external runtime family (`loom_native`) now has a tested
  kernel-side reference adapter library
- one tested legacy-compatible federation seam now exists in OSS tests:
  those kernel-side adapter hooks can wrap a federated `execution_request`
  story end-to-end
- one host-service federation primitive now exists as a kernel reference:
  HMAC-signed envelopes, peer registry, and replay protection
- one receiver-side federation inbox primitive now exists as a kernel reference:
  accepted envelopes persist into an institution-scoped capsule inbox instead
  of existing only as audit lines
- one receiver-side settlement notice application path now exists as a kernel
  reference: a valid `settlement_notice` can settle a linked commitment on the
  receiver and transition the inbox entry from `received` to `processed`
- one receiver-side execution review path now exists as a kernel reference:
  a valid `execution_request` can materialize a local federated execution job
  plus a pending local warrant, instead of overclaiming that the sender's
  warrant is enough to authorize receiver-side work
- one sender-side review feedback path now exists as a kernel reference:
  receiver-side warrant review for `execution_request` can emit a signed
  `court_notice`, so the sender can sync warrant review state and linked
  commitment provenance before settlement
- one first-class warrant primitive now exists as a kernel reference:
  file-backed warrant records, warrant review state, and sender-side
  federation execution gating for `execution_request`
- two institution-owned service surfaces now exist as kernel references:
  capsule-backed `subscriptions` and `accounting`, both surfaced through the
  reference workspace as institution-bound session services
- one integrated 3-host federation proof now exists in tests:
  commitment proposal/acceptance, execution review, court notice, breach
  notice, and witness archival compose into one end-to-end kernel story
- the executable public proof map now lives in
  [`docs/PROOF_MATRIX.md`](docs/PROOF_MATRIX.md), with a focused bundle
  generator at [`examples/generate_public_proof_bundle.py`](examples/generate_public_proof_bundle.py)
  that emits structured reference proofs and can optionally embed a public
  live host receipt from `GET /api/federation/manifest`

What is not yet broadly proven in public code:
- live end-to-end hosted deployment wiring
- general MCP middleware enforcement
- general A2A adapter enforcement
- live multi-institution routing inside one deployed service boundary

That means the thesis is larger than the current adapter proof, by design.
The code now says that honestly instead of implying otherwise.

## Court-First Warrant Primitive

Meridian now has a first-class warrant record for sensitive execution paths.
Today that proof is deliberately narrow:

- warrants are institution-scoped and capsule-backed
- warrants record action class, boundary, actor, session, request hash, and TTL
- workspace APIs can issue, approve, stay, revoke, and inspect warrants
- the surfaced boundary registry declares warrant requirements per message type
  for boundaries such as `federation_gateway`
- sender-side federated `execution_request` delivery requires an executable
  warrant and records that `warrant_id` in sender and receiver audit provenance

This is the first real court-first execution gate in public code. It is not
yet the complete payout/commitment/cross-host court program.

## Commitment Primitive

Meridian now also has a first-class commitment record for cross-institution
obligations that need explicit lifecycle state before federation delivery.
Today that proof is also deliberately narrow:

- commitments are institution-scoped and capsule-backed
- commitments bind a target host and target institution explicitly
- workspace APIs can propose, accept, reject, breach, settle, and inspect
  commitments
- sender-side federation delivery can validate an accepted `commitment_id`
  before any envelope is sent
- warrant-bound `commitment_proposal` envelopes can create mirrored
  commitment records on a peer host
- warrant-bound `commitment_acceptance` envelopes can move the source
  commitment into `accepted` from peer-side review
- warrant-bound `commitment_breach_notice` envelopes can move the source
  commitment into `breached`, auto-open a linked case, and stay the linked
  warrant without inventing peer suspension semantics
- successful delivery can append delivery references back onto the commitment
  record
- successful sender-side `execution_request` deliveries can now preserve import-
  grade delivery provenance (`receipt_id`, `payload_hash`, `task`, and
  `adapter_envelope`) on the linked commitment record, giving Loom a kernel-
  owned sender handoff without claiming a general execution outbox or transport
  replacement

This is the first real commitment primitive in public code. It is not yet the
full cross-institution commitments, payout, and breach-handling program.

## Inter-Institution Case Surface

Meridian now also has a first public case record for cross-institution dispute
handling. Today that proof is still intentionally narrow:

- cases are institution-scoped and capsule-backed
- cases bind a target host and target institution explicitly
- workspace APIs can open, stay, resolve, and inspect cases
- commitment breach can auto-open a linked local case record
- commitment breach can also freeze the breaching peer when the case targets a
  peer host
- open or stayed cases surface blocking commitment IDs / peer host IDs
- risky case classes can auto-suspend a trusted peer and block sender-side
  federation delivery
- `/api/cases/open`, `/api/cases/stay`, and `/api/cases/resolve` can federate
  a `case_notice` message type so the receiver can mirror the case state
  against the source host / source institution / source_case_id key
- active case state also blocks commitment settlement until court review clears
  the linked commitment
- contradictory delivery receipts can now auto-open sender-side case records
- if that contradiction is linked to an execution warrant, the sender can
  automatically stay that warrant before any retried execution

This is the first public court-network object beyond warrants and commitment
records. It is not yet the full peer suspension, witness-host, or settlement
freeze program.

## Federation Inbox Surface

Meridian now also has a first-class receiver-side inbox for cross-host
messages:

- accepted federation envelopes persist into an institution-scoped capsule file
- the inbox preserves source/target host and institution bindings, message
  type, warrant / commitment references, payload hash, payload, receipt ID,
  and received / processed state
- `GET /api/federation/inbox` exposes the current inbox state for the bound
  institution

This is no longer receiver-side persistence only. The current kernel reference
can also apply a valid `settlement_notice` onto a local accepted commitment and
append the resulting settlement reference, while still leaving blocked notices
in `received` state when case review prevents settlement. Before any notice is
applied, the receiver replays the same settlement-adapter preflight contract
used by payout execution; invalid notices open `invalid_settlement_notice`
cases and can automatically suspend the peer on the reference path. It is not
yet the full warrant-first cross-host execution program.

## Receiver-Side Federated Execution Jobs

Meridian now also has a first receiver-side execution review object for
incoming cross-host work:

- accepted `execution_request` envelopes can create capsule-backed
  federated execution jobs keyed by `envelope_id`
- those jobs surface sender provenance, payload hash, linked commitment, and a
  local receiver warrant ID
- the receiver issues a local `federated_execution` warrant in
  `pending_review` state rather than treating the sender's warrant as
  sufficient local authority
- approving that local warrant transitions the job to `ready`; staying or
  revoking it transitions the job to `blocked` or `rejected`
- that same local review can emit a signed `court_notice` back to the source
  host, so sender-side warrant state reflects receiver-side review without
  pretending work settlement already completed
- `GET /api/federation/execution-jobs` exposes that queue for the bound
  institution
- `POST /api/federation/execution-jobs/execute` can complete a `ready` job on
  the reference path, persist local execution refs, mark the local warrant
  executed, and reuse those refs to send one `settlement_notice` back to the
  source host when the job is linked to a commitment

This is still a reference-path close-loop, not distributed settlement
finality: the job proves local completion and transport back to the sender,
but higher-order economic trust still depends on commitment, court, and peer
state.

## Payout Proposal Primitive

Meridian now also has a first real payout proposal primitive for
institution-owned contributor compensation. Today that proof is still
deliberately narrow:

- payout proposals are institution-scoped and capsule-backed
- workspace APIs can propose, submit, review, approve, reject, cancel, open a
  dispute window, and inspect proposal state
- execution is warrant-bound through `action_class = payout_execution`
- execution also enforces wallet eligibility, reserve-floor surplus, and a
  phase-5 contributor-payout gate before funds move
- payout execution validates a file-backed settlement adapter contract before
  funds move, including verifier-readiness and accepted attestation types for
  non-ledger adapters
- successful execution appends a `payout_execution` row to the institution
  transaction journal and links warrant execution refs back to the proposal
  with normalized proof / verification / finality fields
- `GET /api/treasury/settlement-adapters` surfaces the registered adapter
  contract and the host-supported subset for the current institution
- `POST /api/treasury/settlement-adapters/preflight` exposes the same contract
  as a non-executing validation path, so callers can inspect adapter status,
  host support, and proof requirements before attempting execution

This is the first public payout object in Meridian. It is not yet the full
settlement-adapter, multi-institution payout network.

## Institution-Owned Service Surfaces

Meridian now also has two public institution-owned service surfaces beyond the
core five primitives:

- `subscriptions` is capsule-backed and exposed through the reference
  workspace as an institution-bound session surface for entitlement state,
  payment verification, delivery targeting, and delivery logging
- `accounting` is capsule-backed and exposed through the reference workspace as
  an institution-bound session surface for owner-ledger state, expense
  recording, reimbursement, and owner draws

These are real kernel-side services, not yet a full cross-institution service
network. The reference workspace proves the single-process institution-bound
path; it does not yet claim general multi-org request routing.

## Five Primitives

### Institution (`kernel/organizations.py`)

The top-level governed container. Every agent, budget, and policy exists
within an institution.

- **Charter** — founding purpose and constitutional text
- **Policy defaults** — budget caps, approval thresholds, sanction rules
- **Lifecycle** — `founding` → `active` → `suspended` → `dissolved`
- **Settings** — extensible key-value configuration

### Agent (`kernel/agent_registry.py`)

First-class managed entity with identity and governance state.

- **Identity** — unique ID, name, role, purpose, organization membership
- **Scopes** — what the agent is allowed to do (e.g., `read`, `research`, `execute`)
- **Budget** — per-run and per-day spending limits
- **Risk state** — `nominal` → `elevated` → `critical` → `suspended`
- **Lifecycle** — `provisioned` → `active` → `quarantined` → `decommissioned`
- **Economy participation** — REP score, AUTH score, incident count
- **Runtime binding** — explicit field mapping agent to a specific runtime ID,
  kept coherent with the runtime registry and surfaced workspace views

Risk auto-escalation: 3+ incidents → elevated, 5+ → critical.

### Authority (`kernel/authority.py`)

Controls who can do what and when.

- **Approval queue** — agents request permission for actions; approvers decide
- **Delegations** — time-boxed scope delegation between agents
- **Kill switch** — global halt on all non-owner actions across all runtimes
- **Sprint leadership** — rotating lead rights based on authority score
- **Action checks** — composable `check_authority(agent, action)` gate

Composes over `economy/authority.py` which provides the scoring and block matrix.

### Treasury (`kernel/treasury.py`)

Real money tracking with enforcement.

- **Balance** — actual cash held
- **Reserve floor** — minimum balance policy
- **Runway** — balance minus reserve floor (negative = blocked)
- **Budget enforcement** — `check_budget(agent, cost)` blocks when underfunded
- **Spend tracking** — per-agent, per-org metering (runtime-reported)
- **Revenue summary** — governance facade over the economy layer
- **Contributor protocol** — wallet registry, payout proposals, funding sources
- **Settlement adapter registry** — institution policy describing which payout
  adapters are registered, which are execution-enabled, and what proof/finality
  contract each adapter requires

No new database layer — treasury resolves through capsule-backed economy state
and `kernel/metering.jsonl`.

### Court (`kernel/court.py`)

Accountability enforcement.

- **Violations** — typed records (weak output, rejected output, rework,
  token waste, false confidence, critical failure)
- **Severity ladder** — 1-6, mapping to escalating sanctions
- **Sanctions** — probation, lead ban, zero authority, remediation only
- **Appeals** — agents can challenge violations; decisions lift or uphold sanctions
- **Remediation** — structured path back from sanctions after violations resolve
- **Auto-review** — wraps economy sanctions into court violation records

Severity-to-sanction mapping:

| Severity | Type | Sanction |
|----------|------|----------|
| 1-2 | Light failure | None (no reward) |
| 3 | Rejected output | Probation |
| 4 | Rework creation | Lead ban |
| 5 | False confidence | Zero authority |
| 6 | Critical failure | Remediation only |

## Runtime Adapter Primitive (`kernel/runtime_adapter.py`)

The runtime adapter is the bridge between Meridian governance and external
agent runtimes. It provides:

- **Runtime registry** (`kernel/runtimes.json`) — machine-readable catalog of
  registered runtimes with protocol support, identity mode, and contract status;
  this is the registry truth used to interpret agent `runtime_binding`
- **Contract checker** — reports registry-declared compliance against the seven
  constitutional requirements
- **Registration** — new runtimes register themselves with contract compliance data
- **CLI** — `runtime_adapter.py list`, `check-contract`, `check-all`

Currently registered runtimes:

| Runtime | Type | Contract Status |
|---------|------|----------------|
| `local_kernel` | local | Compliant (7/7) |
| `loom_native` | hosted | Active (7/7) — primary Meridian runtime with 11 live runtime planes and native contract compliance |
| `legacy_v1_compatible` | hosted | Active (adapter bridge) — bounded compatibility seam for legacy integration paths |
| `mcp_generic` | mcp_app | Planned (2/7, no adapter yet) |
| `a2a_generic` | a2a_agent | Planned (1/7, no adapter yet) |
| `openfang_compatible` | hosted | Planned (0/7, no adapter yet) |

See [Constitutional Runtime Contract](docs/RUNTIME_CONTRACT.md) for the full
requirements and integration guide. Today the built-in `local_kernel` path is
the real reference runtime path, and `loom_native` is the primary active
runtime. The legacy bridge remains available for bounded compatibility paths. That is real public proof, but
it is still not the same thing as a live deployment proving runtime-side event
routing end-to-end.

## Economy Layer

The kernel composes over a three-ledger economy:

| Ledger | Purpose | Properties |
|--------|---------|------------|
| **REP** (reputation) | Long-term trust | Non-transferable, earned from accepted output, decays on inactivity |
| **AUTH** (authority) | Temporary power | Earned from recent output, decays every epoch, suspendable |
| **CASH** (treasury) | Real money | Only from owner capital, support contributions, or customer payments, never self-minted |

Key rule: these ledgers are **never collapsed into one token**. REP measures
trust, AUTH measures current authority, CASH measures money. Agents optimize
for value creation, not token accumulation.

## Composition Pattern

```
┌──────────────────────────────┐
│  Kernel Primitives           │  Composes over economy layer
│  (governance, enforcement)   │  Imports and extends, never rewrites
├──────────────────────────────┤
│  Economy Layer               │  Scoring, sanctions, authority rules
│  (REP, AUTH, CASH mechanics) │  The computational substrate
├──────────────────────────────┤
│  Agent Runtime               │  Any execution environment
│  (your choice)               │  Loom, MCP, A2A, LangChain, custom
└──────────────────────────────┘
```

Each kernel primitive imports specific functions from economy modules
using `importlib.util.spec_from_file_location()` to avoid name collisions
(both layers have files named `authority.py`).

## State Management

All state is JSON/JSONL on the local filesystem. This is deliberate:
- No database dependency for getting started
- Easy to inspect, backup, and version
- Append-only audit trail via JSONL
- Alternative storage backends (SQLite, PostgreSQL) are possible future extensions

State files are gitignored by default. The `bootstrap.py` script
initializes clean state for a new deployment.

## Governed Workspace

`kernel/workspace.py` serves an HTML dashboard + JSON API on a local port.
This is the owner-facing control surface:

- **GET endpoints** — read all primitive state including runtime registry
- **POST endpoints** — engage kill switch, file violations, approve requests, etc.
- **Auto-refresh** — dashboard updates every 15 seconds
- **Audit trail** — every action logged

The workspace is a single-institution demo/reference surface, not a production UI.
It binds the process to exactly one institution, either by default founding/demo
selection or explicitly via `--org-id`. `/api/context` reports that bound
context, and request-level `org_id` or `X-Meridian-Org-Id` hints are only
accepted on exact match. There is still no request-level multi-org routing or
org-scoped auth. The optional workspace auth scope can also be pinned with
`MERIDIAN_WORKSPACE_AUTH_ORG_ID` or `org_id:` in the credentials file so
Basic-auth credentials and bound institution agree explicitly. Add
`MERIDIAN_WORKSPACE_USER_ID` or `user_id:` as well if you want mutation
authorization and audit attribution to resolve through a real institution
member role instead of a generic Basic-auth username. `/api/context` now
returns the effective mutation permission snapshot for that bound actor.
`/api/context` and `/api/status` also expose `runtime_core`, which answers
three runtime-core questions directly in surfaced state:
- what institution this process is acting for
- what host is serving that institution
- what identity model governs the current boundary
- how additional institutions are admitted without cross-org bleed
- whether host-service federation is enabled and which peers are trusted

`/api/agents` surfaces each agent record's `runtime_binding`, `/api/status`
includes the same binding in the workspace snapshot, and `/api/runtimes`
surfaces the runtime registry truth those bindings refer to.

In the OSS reference workspace, the current admission mode is
`single_process_per_institution`: a second institution is admitted by binding a
separate process, not by turning on request-level multi-org routing.
`/api/admission` now exposes that host admission state directly, and
owner-authenticated `POST /api/admission/admit|suspend|revoke` calls are the
explicit file-backed path for admitting, pausing, or revoking institutions on
the current host.
The federation gateway is now a real boundary in the service registry, but it
remains a host-service primitive. It proves signed cross-host identity and
replay protection, not broad multi-host execution parity.
Successful federated deliveries can also fan out envelope/payload/receipt
snapshots to configured witness-host peers and return the archival outcomes to
the sender, but only when the peer registry explicitly opts that peer into
witness archival and the witness host advertises an enabled witness archive.
Production deployments would build their own control plane
or adapter bridge on top of the Python primitives.  The demo JSON API is a
reference surface, not a full remote governance adapter API.

For the concrete handoff from local demo to real deployment, see
[Deployment Guide](docs/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md).

## Example Vertical

`examples/intelligence/` demonstrates how to map a real workflow onto the
five primitives. It is one example vertical — not the definition of Meridian.

Any workflow can be mapped the same way:
- Phase-to-agent mapping
- Preflight gates checking all five primitives before execution
- Post-mortem analysis that files court violations on failures
- Budget enforcement per phase
- Authority checks per action

The intelligence vertical uses the `local_kernel` runtime. The same
constitutional pipeline applies to any runtime that satisfies the contract.

## Capsule Isolation

`kernel/capsule.py` (539 LOC) provides institution-scoped state isolation.
Each institution gets its own capsule directory containing:

- `ledger.json` — economy ledger state
- `revenue.json` — revenue records
- `authority_queue.json` — pending authority requests
- `court.json` — violation and sanction records
- `commitments.json` — cross-institution commitments
- `cases.json` — dispute cases
- `warrants.json` — inspection/execution warrants
- `federation_inbox.json` — received federation envelopes
- `subscriptions.json` — subscription entitlements
- `accounting.json` — owner accounting records

**Current state (PROVEN):** capsules provide directory-level isolation within
a single process. One capsule per institution. No cross-institution state bleed.
Used by workspace.py and tested across 5 test files.

**Future formalization:** portable governed capsules — signed, transmittable
bundles with integrity manifests and provenance chains. See
[CAPSULE_SPEC.md](docs/CAPSULE_SPEC.md) for the full formalization, including
what exists today, what is proposed, and what remains future work.

## Operator Language

Meridian defines a terminal-first operator grammar shared across all command
surfaces. This includes:

- **Command voice:** `meridian init`, `meridian check`, `meridian doctor`
- **Status vocabulary:** governance-native terms (`NOMINAL`, `PROBATION`,
  `ZERO_AUTHORITY`, `FUNDED`, `BELOW_FLOOR`) instead of generic green/yellow/red
- **Output severity:** `OK`, `NOTICE`, `WARN`, `CRITICAL`, `BLOCKED`
- **Proof commands:** `meridian proof-bundle`, `meridian verify-runtime`

Today the operator surface is the workspace HTML dashboard plus CLI subcommands
in `runtime_adapter.py`, `court.py`, and `treasury.py`. The operator language
spec formalizes these into a unified grammar that future CLI tooling and TUI
surfaces will implement.

See [OPERATOR_LANGUAGE.md](docs/OPERATOR_LANGUAGE.md) for the full specification.

## Subsystems

### Contributor Treasury Protocol

`treasury/` contains the contributor economy layer built on top of the Treasury
primitive.  The protocol registries (wallets, accounts, contributors, maintainers,
payout proposals, funding sources) define the schema and state machines but have
**zero real entries** — no payouts have ever been executed.  This is infrastructure
ready for use when the project has real contributors and revenue.

- Wallet registry with five verification levels
- Payout proposal state machine with 72-hour dispute window
- Fraud and dispute policy mapping to the Court primitive

See [Contributor Treasury Protocol](docs/treasury/CONTRIBUTOR_TREASURY_PROTOCOL.md).
