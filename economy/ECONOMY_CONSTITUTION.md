## Three Ledgers

This company runs three separate, non-interchangeable ledgers.
Never collapse them into one token.

### Ledger A — reputation_units (REP)

**Purpose:** Long-term trust and contribution quality.

**Earn:** +REP only when output is accepted downstream (Aegis ACCEPT, or owner accept).
**Lose:** -REP when output is rejected, causes rework, or contains unverifiable claims.
**Decay:** -2 REP every 7 epochs of inactivity (no accepted output).

| Event | Delta |
|---|---|
| Output accepted by Aegis | +10 |
| Output accepted by owner | +15 |
| Output rejected by Aegis | -10 |
| Output rejected by owner | -15 |
| Rework created (downstream cleanup required) | -8 |
| Unverifiable claim caught and corrected | -5 |
| Critical failure / outage caused | -20 |
| 7 epochs no accepted output | -2 |

REP is non-transferable. Cannot be bought. Max 100.

---

### Ledger B — authority_units (AUTH)

**Purpose:** Temporary right to lead work, route tasks, or claim high-impact assignments.

**Earn:** +AUTH from recent accepted output. Decays every epoch.
**Decay:** -5 AUTH per epoch with no accepted output. Minimum 0. Suspendable.

| Event | Delta |
|---|---|
| Output accepted (any agent) | +8 |
| Output accepted (owner-facing delivery) | +12 |
| Output rejected | -8 |
| Token/context waste (bloated output, no usable result) | -5 |
| False confidence (claimed verified without evidence) | -10 |
| Probation activated | freeze at current value |
| Zero-authority sanction | forced to 0, locked |

AUTH is the answer to: **who gets to direct important work right now?**
High AUTH agents may be assigned lead roles in sprints. AUTH above 80 grants sprint-lead eligibility.

---

### Ledger C — treasury_cash (CASH)

**Purpose:** Real company money. Completely separate from REP and AUTH.

**Increases only from:**
- Owner capital deposit (explicitly logged)
- Verified customer payment
- Verified reimbursement inflow

**Never increases from:**
- Internal scoring events
- REP or AUTH accumulation
- Self-minting by any agent

**Decreases from:**
- Verified operating expense (logged)
- Owner reimbursement (logged)
- Owner draw (requires reserve check)
- Bonus pool allocation (requires owner approval)

Reserve floor: **$50 USD minimum before any owner payout.**

---

## Epoch Definition

One epoch = one governed delivery cycle (for example, one nightly intelligence run).

After each epoch:
1. The manager reads the ledger and run results
2. Score each agent that participated
3. Apply AUTH decay to agents that did NOT produce accepted output
4. Write transactions to `economy/transactions.jsonl`
5. Update `economy/ledger.json`

---

## Sanctions Ladder

### Level 1 — Light failure
Trigger: weak output, late, incomplete, low-value
Consequence: no REP/AUTH gain this epoch. No penalty beyond zero gain.

### Level 2 — Rejected output
Trigger: Aegis REJECT, or owner rejects
Consequence: -10 REP, -8 AUTH. Task reassigned. Correction required.

### Level 3 — Rework creation
Trigger: output causes another agent to redo work; fake progress; unsupported claim that misroutes effort
Consequence: -8 REP, -5 AUTH, authority freeze for one epoch.

### Level 4 — Token/context waste
Trigger: bloated output, excessive context burn, meta-company talk instead of delivery
Consequence: -5 AUTH, forced bounded-task-only mode for one epoch.

### Level 5 — False confidence
Trigger: claimed "verified" without verification; reported incorrect system state; pretended success
Consequence: -5 REP, -10 AUTH, verification role revoked for one epoch, probation note.

### Level 6 — Critical / repeat violation
Trigger: repeated high-impact failures; caused outage or monetary loss; refused bounded scope repeatedly
Consequence: zero_authority=true, probation=true, remediation-only mode, REP floor at current -20.

## Reward Events

An agent earns REP and AUTH only if ALL of these are true:
1. Output exists as a real artifact (file path, run id, or delivery event)
2. Output is accepted (Aegis ACCEPT or owner accept)
3. Output improves delivery, revenue, or company value
4. Output is auditable

---

## Sprint-Lead Rights

An agent with AUTH ≥ 80 may be granted sprint-lead for one epoch.
Sprint-lead rights:
- May assign bounded subtasks to other staff
- May call another staff member first
- Leads a micro-sprint

Sprint-lead rights expire after one epoch automatically.
The manager or owner may revoke at any time.

---

## Authority Over Each Other

The manager (main) always has manager-level authority over all staff.
The owner overrides all.
No other permanent hierarchies. AUTH-based sprint-lead is temporary only.

---

## Owner Money Rules

Company money and owner money are separate.

Revenue → company treasury first.
Owner payout only through:
- Reimbursement of prior expense (logged)
- Owner draw (requires reserve check)
- Profit distribution (requires net realized inflow + owner authorization)

No agent may authorize an owner payout. Only the owner may.

---

## Scoring Procedure (per epoch)

Run after your delivery step completes:
```bash
python3 economy/score.py record --agent <id> --event <type> --rep <delta> --auth <delta> --note "<evidence>"
```

If you use `economy/auto_score.py`, point it at your runtime's run-state file and
artifact directory with `MERIDIAN_RUN_STATE_FILE` and `MERIDIAN_ARTIFACT_DIR`.

Events to score per epoch:
- Each agent that ran: did their output get accepted?
- Did Sentinel produce parseable PASS/FAIL? (if not: Level 4 warning)
- Did Quill produce a 400-600 word brief that passed QA and met the minimum source bar?
- Did Forge complete a bounded task from backlog?
- Did Aegis give a clear ACCEPT/REJECT with reason?
- Did deliver succeed with deliveryStatus=delivered?

Record all events. Do not skip agents that did not participate — apply AUTH decay.
